# OpenClaw UI — Generative UI for OpenClaw

OpenClaw UI is the **OpenClaw integration for [OpenUI](https://openui.com)** — a server-side plugin and a streaming web client that turn any OpenClaw agent's responses into live, interactive UI: charts, tables, forms, dashboards, cards. Instead of plain markdown, agents emit structured [OpenUI Lang](https://openui.com), and the client renders it as React components in real time.

## What is OpenClaw UI?

<!-- Add demo gif here:

</div>
-->

OpenClaw UI is a two-part system that adds generative UI to any OpenClaw agent:

- **`@openuidev/openclaw-ui-plugin`** — an OpenClaw server-side plugin that detects Claw sessions and injects an OpenUI Lang system prompt into the agent's context, so the LLM responds with structured UI markup instead of text.
- **`@openuidev/claw-client`** — a Next.js web client that connects to your OpenClaw gateway over WebSocket and renders agent responses as live, interactive components using the OpenUI React renderer.

**Core capabilities:**

- **Drop-in plugin** — Install once into your OpenClaw gateway; works for every agent.
- **Session-scoped activation** — Other clients (CLI, scripts, third-party apps) on the same gateway are unaffected.
- **Streaming renderer** — Components render progressively as the LLM streams tokens.
- **Built on OpenUI Lang** — Up to 67% more token-efficient than equivalent JSON output.
- **Apps, artifacts, notifications, uploads** — Persistent, addressable UI primitives backed by the plugin.
- **No build step for the plugin** — OpenClaw loads it as raw TypeScript via [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti).

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thesysdev/openclaw-ui.git
cd openclaw-ui
pnpm install
```

### 2. Install the plugin into your OpenClaw gateway

```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ./packages/claw-plugin
openclaw restart
```

### 3. Start the client

```bash
cd packages/claw-client
pnpm dev   # http://localhost:18790
```

Open the URL, paste your gateway URL and auth token into settings, and start chatting. Agent responses now render as live, interactive UI.

> Need your gateway URL and token?
> ```bash
> node scripts/connection-info.mjs
> ```
> reads them from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["OpenClaw Agent"] --> B["claw-plugin<br/>(before_prompt_build)"]
    B --> C["LLM"]
    C --> D["OpenUI Lang stream"]
    D --> E["claw-client<br/>(WebSocket + Renderer)"]
    E --> F["Live UI in browser"]
```

1. The Claw client opens a session with the gateway using a key suffixed with `:openclaw-ui`.
2. On each agent run, `claw-plugin`'s `before_prompt_build` hook detects the suffix and prepends the OpenUI Lang system prompt.
3. The LLM streams structured component markup back over the gateway protocol.
4. `claw-client` parses the stream and renders the components progressively into the chat surface.

Sessions from any other client on the same gateway are not modified.

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the full protocol, the plugin detection mechanism, and the agent / session / thread mental model.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`@openuidev/openclaw-ui-plugin`](./packages/claw-plugin) | OpenClaw server-side plugin. Injects the OpenUI Lang system prompt and provides app, artifact, notification, and upload stores. |
| [`@openuidev/claw-client`](./packages/claw-client) | Next.js web client. Connects to the gateway over WebSocket and renders agent output as live components. |

Both packages live in this monorepo and are linked via pnpm workspaces. They are versioned together for now.

## Scripts

Run from the repo root — every script fans out across the workspace.

```bash
pnpm build         # build every package
pnpm lint          # ESLint check across packages
pnpm lint:fix      # ESLint auto-fix
pnpm format        # Prettier check
pnpm format:fix    # Prettier write
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit across packages
pnpm test          # Vitest across packages
pnpm ci            # full lint + format + typecheck + build (matches CI)
```

## Why OpenUI Lang?

OpenUI Lang is designed for model-generated UI that needs to be both structured and streamable.

- **Streaming output** — Emit UI incrementally as tokens arrive.
- **Token efficiency** — Up to 67% fewer tokens than equivalent JSON.
- **Controlled rendering** — Restrict output to the components you define and register.
- **Typed component contracts** — Define component props and structure up front with Zod schemas.

See the [OpenUI documentation](https://openui.com) and [token efficiency benchmarks](https://github.com/thesysdev/openui#token-efficiency-benchmarks) for details.
